# coin-change

Explores the coin change katas. There are three implementations.

The first is a naive solution that ignores the requirement that the
number of coins returned should be minimized.

The second solution is a correct solution that recursively looks for
all solutions. I haven't done the code to actually pick out the
smallest but that should be relatively simple.

The third solution uses the loco constraint programming library. This
is completely new to me but I'm very happy with how easy this solution
turned out to be.
